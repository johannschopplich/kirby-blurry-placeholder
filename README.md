# Kirby Blurry Placeholder

This plugin implements progressive image loading, providing a better user experience. Tiny thumbnails which inherit the aspect ratio of their source image are combined with a blurry effect for a better placeholder than solid colors, without sacrificing payload.

How it works:

1. An inline, URI-encoded SVG fills the `src` attribute of a given image element. The blurred image is wrapped in a SVG to avoid rasterizing the filter.
2. The large images are then only requests when they are within the viewport.

## Key Features

- ‚ú® Avoids content jumping (keeping aspect ratio)
- ü•® Respects [custom image formats](https://getkirby.com/docs/guide/templates/resize-images-on-the-fly#image-formats), like WebP and AVIF
- üèó Use as:
  - [Image block](#as-kirby-image-block)
  - [Kirbytag](#as-kirbytag)
  - [File method](#as-file-method)
- [ü¶å Loadeer.js](https://github.com/johannschopplich/loadeer) for lazy loading in the frontend
- üîç SEO-friendly

## Requirements

- Kirby 3.6+
- PHP 8.0+

## Installation

### Download

Download and copy this repository to `/site/plugins/kirby-blurry-placeholder`.

### Git Submodule

```bash
git submodule add https://github.com/johannschopplich/kirby-blurry-placeholder.git site/plugins/kirby-blurry-placeholder
```

### Composer

```bash
composer require johannschopplich/kirby-blurry-placeholder
```

## Usage

### As Kirby Image Block

Each Kirby site is tailored to its own use-case, thus this plugin won't add a Kirby block by default. Instead, take a look into the provided [image block example](./snippets/blocks/image.php) to get an idea of how to implement blurry placeholders within blocks.

Of course, you can just copy the block into your `site/snippets/blocks` folder of your current Kirby project, use it as is or adapt it to your needs!

### As File Method

`$file->placeholderUri()` creates and returns the URI-encoded SVG placeholder.

```html
<!-- Using the `placeholderUri` for an inlined image in the `src` attribute -->
<img
  src="<?= $image->placeholderUri() ?>"
  data-src="<?= $image->url() ?>"
  data-lazyload
  alt="<?= $image->alt() ?>"
/>
```

#### Cropped Images

> Kirby doesn't support file methods on cropped files/images, because the latter inherit the `Kirby\Cms\FileVersion` class.

Pass the ratio of a cropped image to the placeholder method to generate a cropped preview:

```php
<?php $cropped = $original->crop(500, 400) ?>
<img
  src="<?= $original->placeholderUri(5/4) ?>"
  data-src="<?= $cropped->url() ?>"
  data-lazyload
  alt="<?= $original->alt() ?>"
/>
```

### As Kirbytag

This plugin doesn't overwrite the core `(image: ‚Ä¶)` Kirbytag, but builds upon it for a custom tag. Thus, all of the options present in Kirby's `(image: ‚Ä¶)` tag are available in the plugin's tag as well.

The `(blurryimage: ‚Ä¶)` tag:

- Encodes a blurry image placeholder as URI in the `src` attribute.
- Sets the original image's URL as `data-src` or a set of responsive images as `data-srcset`.
- Adds a `data-lazyload` attribute for selection by the lazy loading library.

Example use within a [KirbyText](https://getkirby.com/docs/reference/text/kirbytags) field:

```
(blurryimage: myimage.jpg)
(blurryimage: myimage.jpg link: https://example.com)
(blurryimage: myimage.jpg class: is-poster)
```

If you have enabled `srcset`'s in the options, the Kirbytag syntax stays the same. Just the output changes.

## Lazy Loading in the Frontend

To lazily load the images once they get apparent in the viewport, a JavaScript library is necessary.

I strongly recommend [ü¶å Loadeer.js](https://github.com/johannschopplich/loadeer). It has been written with this Kirby plugin in mind. In a nutshell, it's a tiny, performant, SEO-friendly lazy loading library and can be used with or without a build step if you don't have a frontend asset build chain.

### Without Build Step & Auto Initialization

Simply load it from a CDN:

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/loadeer" defer init></script>
```

- The `defer` attribute makes the script execute after HTML content is parsed.
- The `init` attribute tells Loadeer.js to automatically initialize and watch all elements that have a `data-lazyload` attribute.

### Import As ES Module

You can use the ES module build by installing the `loadeer` npm package:

```js
import Loadeer from "loadeer";

const instance = new Loadeer();
instance.observe();
```

### Automatically Calculate the `sizes` Attribute

Loadeer.js supports setting the `sizes` attribute automatically, corresponding to the current size of your image. For this to work, the `data-sizes` attribute has to be set to `auto`. If you have `srcset`'s enabled in your configuration, this is already done for you when using the `(blurryimage: ‚Ä¶)` Kirbytag.

### Use a Lazy Loader of Your Choice

Each parsed Kirbytag adds the `data-lazyload` attribute to the `img` element. Consequently, you can let a lazy loader of choice select these elements by passing `[data-lazyload]` as selector.

### Animating with the "Blur Down" Technique

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Disclaimer**: Please avoid copying any code until reading this section in full. This is an experimental technique that comes with caveats (mostly performance issues).

When using Loadeer.js, we can target all lazyloaded images with `[data-lazyload]` and refine this selection with `[data-src]` only to target the images that haven't been fully loaded yet.

```css
img[data-lazyload][data-src] {
  filter: blur(150px);
  transform: scale(1.2);
}
```

We can then apply a transition to such properties.

```css
/* Respect users choice for reduced motion */
@media (prefers-reduced-motion: no-preference) {
  img[data-lazyload] {
    transition: 1.2s cubic-bezier(0.86, 0.07, 0.07, 0.96);
    transition-property: filter, transform;
    /* Hint browser at change for better performance */
    will-change: filter, transform;
  }
}
```

As we are manually blurring the `img` **element** which `src` attribute is our generated SVG (so essentially the SVG is a child of our `img` element), we _need_ to have a container that hides overflowing parts. For better performance we also enforce GPU rendering by applying a `transform` declaration.

```css
.img-container {
  overflow: hidden;
  /* Enforce GPU rendering */
  transform: translateZ(0);
}
```

The biggest caveat with this implementation is the transition of `filter` ‚Äì users on lower-end devices will probably experience frame drops. Even using `transform` to enforce GPU rendering and using `will-change` as last resort of hinting the at the transition does not always fix such issues. In the end, it heavily depends on what devices your end users are on, how big the painted image is on the site and how many images your site features (that might all blur up at the same time).

So should you implement a "blur down" transition? **Probably not.** If you do, strongly consider the caveats. The best animation is the one that engages users, not the one that scares them.

## Options

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è The plugin's options namespace was changed to `johannschopplich.blurry-placeholder` in v2.0.1. All options from the former `kirby-extended.blurry-placeholder` are deprecated, but still supported as a fallback.

| Option (`johannschopplich.blurry-placeholder.<option>`) | Default | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| ------------------------------------------------------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `pixel-target`                                          | `60`    | Aim for a placeholder image of ~P pixels (`w \* h = ~P`).                                                                                                                                                                      |
| `kirbytag.srcset-preset`                                | `null`  | A preset passed to [Kirby's `srcset` method](https://getkirby.com/docs/reference/objects/cms/file/srcset#define-presets) when using the Kirbytag. If `null` (default), a `src` attribute will be rendered instead of `srcset`. |
| `kirbytag.sizes`                                        | `auto`  | String for the `data-sizes` attribute if the Kirbytag works with `srcset`'s.                                                                                                                                                   |

> All of the `srcset` options have to be wrapped in an array.

To give an example for your `config.php`:

```php
return [
    'johannschopplich.blurry-placeholder' => [
        'pixel-target' => 60,
        'kirbytag' => [
            'srcset-preset' => 'article'
        ]
    ]
];
```
